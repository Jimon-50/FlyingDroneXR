        <h3>Privacy Policy for FlyingDrone XR</h3>
        <p>Tatsuya Igarashi (hereinafter referred to as "the developer") built the FlyingDrone XR application (hereinafter referred to as "the app"), available via Apple's App Store. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the app collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (hereinafter referred to as "you" or "the user").</p>
        <p><strong>Information The Developer Collect</strong></p>
        <p>The app does not collect any personally identifiable information or sensitive data from you. The developer does not request or store any personal information, such as your name, address, email, or phone number.</p>
        <p>The app requires access to your device's camera and microphone to render AR (Augmented Reality) space on the device's screen. The app also requires access to all photos managed by the iOS Photos app to store the AR image as a photo and a video. With user consent, the app accesses the device's location information, including the WiFi and GPS geographical coordinates, solely for the purpose of including it in the photos and videos taken by the app.</p>
        <p>The photos and videos you take using the app are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted or shared with the developer or any third party without your explicit consent.</p>
        <p><strong>Use of Sharing Features</strong></p>
        <p>When you share a photo and a video from within the app, it may include user information and associated location information.
        <p>Please note that any data shared through third-party services, such as email, social media platforms, or other installed applications, is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service.</p>
        <p><strong>Use of Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>The developer does not use any third-party analytics tools or services that collect or track any user information with the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
        <p>The developer takes the security of your data seriously. The app is designed to store any photos taken within the app securely on your device's local storage. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While the developer strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, the developer cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>The developer reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes we make will be reflected in the updated version of the app, and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
        <p>By continuing to use the app after any modifications to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and accept the changes made via the App Store.
        <p><strong>Contact the developer</strong></p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of the app, please contact the developer at jimon50.web@gmail.com. The developer will be happy to assist you and address any concerns you may have.</p>
        <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the app and its usage. It does not cover any third-party apps or services that you may access through the app.</p>
